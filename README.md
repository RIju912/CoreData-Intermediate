# CoreData - Experiment.


## On this Journey,  what I experimented for Core Data are described below:

### 1.  Create, Read, Update, Delete Operations at Core Data.
### 2.  Core Data Manager & Singleton context.
### 3.  Core Data Migration -> Custom and Automatic lightweight.
### 4.  Core  Data versioning.
### 4.  Core Data background context and threading.

## This repo contains all the source code implementation for the above items.

## To experiment diffent items, you've to comment out different pieces of code.
